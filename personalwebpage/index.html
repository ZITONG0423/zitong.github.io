          But Florida has more than Miami and Orlando. Let me introduce you to the most beautiful fishing village in Florida, "Punta Gorda".
          Punta Gorda is located in the south of Tampa, the third largest city in Florida. It is a small port town, very suitable for those who don't want to rush the trip. Spend three days here for a simple but pleasant warm winter.
          Englewood Beach is the favorite beach of the locals. In this sea area, you can learn about the bay ecosystem, including mangrove estuary and seagrass beach, by playing water projects. You can also lie on the beach and sunbathe, or stop and go to enjoy the scenery.
          The streets here are dotted with rows of royal palm trees. Going deep into the community, you can appreciate the early Florida architectural styles, such as iron roof houses and brick alleys, and experience the retro style of old Florida.

        <h2>Pahoa, Hawaii</h2>
        <div id="overflowTest"><p style="color:rgb(22, 25, 29);"><strong> Hawaii is definitely one of the top destinations for sheltering from the cold in winter. The average winter temperature is around 26 degrees Celsius. However, Oahu, Honolulu, and Maui are almost overcrowded every year-end holiday. , While the small town of Pahoa is much cleaner, without a large number of tourists, it is very suitable for a whole-hearted holiday.
        Pahoa is located on the Big Island of Hawaii. It is known as a small town favored by the volcano goddess Pele, because it is away from one of the most active volcanoes in the world "Kilauea" The distance is less than 0.1 mile, attracting many geological enthusiasts to check in every year.
          In Pahoa, you can almost enjoy the entire beach alone, snorkeling and swimming with tropical marine life, without having to grab the site with a large number of tourists.
          Set foot in the tropical rainforest and breathe in the ultra-fresh air brought by the forest oxygen bar.
          Go to the Main Street of Pahoa to admire the new Victorian architecture and experience the weird and novel collision of hippie culture and traditional Hawaiian culture.
